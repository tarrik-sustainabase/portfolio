   <p>As an engineer, I have found that the two most important skills to have are critical thinking, and questioning everything. Through the use of data, the critical thinking process is assisted, and questions that arise may be answered. </p>
   <p>Searching for answers within a wall of numbers is what data scientists do best. Through the use of thoughtful organization, visualizations, predictive models, and client interactions, we can mitigate environmental degradation, while increasing human wellbeing. </p>
   <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing music (guitar, piano, vocals) and songwriting. As most environmental engineers, I also enjoy being outdoors whether it be hiking, kayaking, gardening, or just walking. </p>
